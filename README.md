# guessingnumber

Today, I want to share a fun and interactive Python project I worked on—the Number Guessing Game. This project may seem simple at first, but it actually involves key programming concepts like randomization, loops, conditional statements, and user input validation.

The game starts by generating a random number between 1 and 100, and the player gets a limited number of attempts to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback—whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

One of the biggest challenges in this project was handling invalid input. What if the user enters letters, symbols like &, *, or even an empty value? To prevent the program from crashing, I implemented input validation using.isdigit() checks. This ensures that only valid numbers are accepted, making the game more robust.

Another interesting aspect of this project was setting a limit on attempts. If the user fails to guess within the given attempts, the game reveals the correct number and ends gracefully.

This project was not just about coding—it was about problem-solving, improving user experience, and making the program foolproof. It reinforced the importance of error handling and logical thinking in programming.
